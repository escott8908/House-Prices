I'm mimicking [this](https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin/house-prices-lasso-xgboost-and-a-detailed-eda) guys kernel somewhat, but with my data???

So, I was thinking this was going to be a great reference for predictive analytics, but it is actually a great tutorial on how to explore the data.  These are VERY important.
